# Parallelized_Pedestrian_Dead-Reckoning

This is a course project which using parallelized kalman filter in trajectory reconstruction of human walking
The algorithm involve forward and backward integrate, as well as a smoother based on covariance matrix

Input source are IMU data, GPS data, barometer data, and pre-processing label
Currently, input files are missing

compute_main.cu contains the main function
